# HTML & CSS - Sass 

## Description


I created a one page website for a restaurant that does not exist 
to exercise/stumble through/test my SASS skills.
Full disclosure I reused existing HTML code from a previous project, just to simplify life a little.
I used these aspects of SASS:

- variables

- nesting

- mixin

- modules

P.s. I made a mistake, I should have made the mobile version before the desktop one
but I didn't and the code is not as clean as it could be.
